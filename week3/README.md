# Discount Calculator in Python

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates how to calculate the final price of an item after applying a discount.  
The program uses a function `calculate_discount(price, discount_percent)` that:
- Applies the discount **only if it is 20% or higher**  
- Otherwise, returns the original price unchanged  

The script also prompts the user to enter the original price and discount percentage, then outputs the final price.

---

## 🛠 Features
- Define a reusable `calculate_discount` function
- Apply discounts conditionally (20% or more)
- Prompt the user for input values
- Format and display the final price
- Handle invalid user inputs (non-numeric values)
